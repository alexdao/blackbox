Footstep
==========

Android app to automatically track carbon emissions based on phone sensor data. 1st Place winner of the Energy and Environment Track at HackDuke, a hackathon hosted by Duke University. 

### About
Created by Alex Dao, Callie Mao, and Danny Oh.

If every commuter were to decrease their carbon dioxide emissions by just 10%, there would be a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions by hundreds of pounds per person. Traditionally, tracking carbon emissions required users to actively record their activities. 

In order to raises awareness of day-to-day subconscious decisions that detrimentally affect the environment. Footstep tracks accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS location data points from your phone. This data forms a probabilistic model on which mode of transportation the phone is most likely to be experiencing (staying still, walking, biking, car, etc). When a "trip" is detected, Footstep will automatically run in the background and track GPS location until a final destination is reached. It will then intelligently stop recording and organize trips based on start/end time and location. 

The results are displayed on a day-to-day basis for a user to view, and each route is accompanied by alternative walking/biking routes that could be taken. Footstep in the future can be extended to intelligently predict when a user will be taking a common commute route and immediately suggest an alternative walking/biking route that matches with a userâ€™s schedule/linked calendar.

### API
